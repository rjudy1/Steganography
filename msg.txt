Sob Story
There were once two programmers and a lonely EE. The EE sat all alone as the programmers created a
clock on an LCD. The programmers made the time have a seizure and quit all together. They also
decided to insert random characters into the time display. The poor clock as being slaughtered by the
programmers. Then they just eliminated the clock all together! In place they put an extensive amount of
running mans, all for some reason saying mooooooo. This man duplicated himself to completely over-
take the screen, leaving no space for the clock to be displayed. The little EE mourned the clock as the
programmers marveled at the mooing running man. Oh mighty broken clock! We miss you and your
hard-coded hour spot! The running man is too quick and overtakes you, faster than you can count. RIP
clock, at least you will ensure the programmers and EE get a good grade.
